                <p> My full name is Nurul Shahirah Binti Abd Rahman and i'm 21 years old. I was born in Selangor, Malaysia 
                    on 11 March 2001. I am the eldest of 3 siblings, also the only daughters in the family. I have a hobby in baking modern 
                    cakes and biscuits like chocolate chip biscuits and red velvet cakes. I also often bake desserts when I am tired of doing 
                    work to release stress because every time I bake desserts I will feel pleasure and to some extent can cheer me up again.

                    <br> 
                    <p>
                            As told in my profile, I have a hobby of baking either cakes or biscuits. As a child at the age of 10 I started to like 
                        watching videos of baking cakes and loved surfing the internet to get cake recipes to try. Due to my young age to do it 
                        myself so I was only allowed to bake desserts when my mother was at home alone. Day by day, I am getting better at baking
                        desserts and I know the functions of cake ingredients like baking powder and bircarbonate soda. I also dont need to look 
                        at recipes when wanting to bake desserts. Entering my age of 14, I started making my hobby something that could generate 
                        money. I started baking biscuits and getting orders when it was Aidilfitri and because I was a student and made biscuits 
                        by myself, so I only took orders from the closest people and at a small rate. I complete bookings on Saturdays and Sundays 
                        considering the other day I was busy all day at school. I managed to meet all the customer requests and at the same time 
                        I also managed to manage my time as a student very well. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                            I also sell several types of cakes after the incident selling biscuits during the festival and my target customers are my school friends and family members. I sell batik cakes and 
                        cheesecakes in small containers so that my schoolmates can afford to buy them at cheap prices. I get support from classmates
                        as well as schoolmates. My younger brother also helps in promoting my desserts to his schoolmates and every day there will 
                        definitely be orders from his friends. From there, I try to fix the shortcomings from the results of baking the cake and try 
                        to satisfy all the wishes of the customer. My aunt also helps in promoting the cakes I make as she also sells traditional 
                        frozen “cakes”. I use weekends to restock batik cakes and cheesecakes so I dont mess up my school days. I am also thankful 
                        that my mother helped me a lot in managing this small business. Because it is now quite busy and there is no time to 
                        continue selling so I stopped selling desserts and focused on what is being done now. But my hobby is always I do even if 
                        I dont continue selling, I still bake desserts if I want peace of mind. I am thankful to have a hobby that pays off and 
                        gives me a lot of experience that taught me the meaning of hard earned money so that I appreciate the value of money more 
                        and work harder if I want something. To some extent, too, I learned life experiences that not everyone can feel.
